# online_bank

- I am learning from Udemy to make online_bank project. It is a project with combination of frontend and backend.
  - frontend: Angular 
  - backend: Java spring
- Currently, it has basic user functions
    - register new user

        - primary account
        ![alt text](public/demo3.jpg)
        - saving account
        ![alt text](public/demo4.jpg)
      - transaction
        - deposit
        - withdraw
      - transfer
      ![alt text](public/demo5.jpg)
        - between-account
        - add/delete recipient
        ![alt text](public/demo7.jpg)
        - to someone else
        ![alt text](public/demo6.jpg)
      - appointment
      ![alt text](public/demo8.jpg)
        - schedule
      - profile 
      ![alt text](public/demo9.jpg)

- This is all that I have done so far, not finished yet, will update more later with more edition. 
- Since it needs angular2 for later function, I need to learn it:(
