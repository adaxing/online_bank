# online_bank

- I am learning from Udemy to make online_bank project. It is a project with combination of frontend and backend. 
- Currently, it has basic user functions
    - register new user 
    - login 
      - account
        - primary account
        - saving account
      - transaction
        - deposit
        - withdraw
      - transfer
        - between-account
        - add/delete recipient
        - to someone else
      - appointment
        - schedule
      - profile 
- This is all that I have done so far, not finished yet, will update more later with more edition. 
- Since it needs angular2 for later function, I need to learn it:(
